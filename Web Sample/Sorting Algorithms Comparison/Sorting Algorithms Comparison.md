# Sorting Algorithms Comparison 🔄

## Overview 🌐

This web page provides a visual representation and comparison of different sorting algorithms. Users can input an array of numbers and choose from various sorting algorithms to observe their sorting performance.

## Structure 🏗️

### Head Section

- Metadata and charset declaration.
- Viewport settings for responsive design.
- Title of the web page.
- Embedded styles defining the look and feel.

### Body Section

- Heading with the title "Sorting Algorithms Comparison."
- A form allowing users to input an array of numbers.
- Buttons for different sorting algorithms (currently including Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, and Insertion Sort).
- Display area for the sorted array and the number of permutations.
- JavaScript functions implementing the sorting algorithms.
- Event listeners for button clicks and input clearing.

## Styles 🎨

The styles define a clean and visually appealing layout:

- Vibrant color scheme.
- Stylish fonts for headings and text.
- Buttons with hover effects.
- Result container with a list for displaying the sorted array and a section for permutation information.
- A table for displaying the sorting process.

## Sorting Algorithms 🧮

The page currently implements three sorting algorithms:

1. **Selection Sort 🎯**
2. **Bubble Sort 🛁**
3. **Insertion Sort 📥**

Additional sorting algorithms can be added by extending the JavaScript code.

## Functionality 🚀

- Users can input an array of numbers in a specified format.
- They can select a sorting algorithm and observe the sorted array along with the number of permutations.
- The page provides a clear button to reset the input and hide the result section.

## Usage 🤓

1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
2. Input an array of numbers.
3. Choose a sorting algorithm.
4. View the sorted array and permutation information.

Feel free to customize and expand upon this web page for more sorting algorithms or additional features. Happy sorting! 🤖🌈
