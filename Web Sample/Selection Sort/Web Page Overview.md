# Selection Sort Webpage 🌐

## Introduction 🚀

This webpage serves as an interactive platform to demonstrate the Selection Sort algorithm, a straightforward comparison-based sorting technique. The design prioritizes clarity and user-friendliness, offering a clean and visually appealing interface.

## Algorithm Information ℹ️

The top section of the page provides information about Selection Sort:

- **Algorithm Description:** Selection sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted region and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted region.
- **Time Complexity (Big O):** O(n^2) - Quadratic time complexity.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) - Constant space complexity.

This section is styled with a pleasing green color, making it visually distinct and engaging.

## Interactive Sorting Section 🔄

Users can interact with the webpage by performing the following actions:

1. **Enter Array:** Input an array of numbers (comma-separated) into the provided text field.
2. **Sort Button:** Click the "Sort" button to trigger the Selection Sort algorithm on the entered array.
3. **Clear Button:** Use the "Clear" button to reset the input field and hide sorting results, facilitating the initiation of a new sorting process.

## Sorting Results Display 📊

After sorting, the webpage displays the sorted array along with the number of permutations performed during the sorting process.

## Sorting Algorithm Comparison Table 📈

Below the interactive section, a comparison table contrasts Selection Sort with other sorting algorithms, providing insights into their time and space complexities. The table is presented in a clear tabular format, making it easy for users to compare the efficiency and characteristics of different sorting algorithms.

## Conclusion 🎉

The webpage effectively combines informative content with interactive features, offering users a practical and educational experience in understanding Selection Sort and its comparison with other sorting algorithms. The color scheme, styling, and layout contribute to a visually appealing and user-friendly design.
