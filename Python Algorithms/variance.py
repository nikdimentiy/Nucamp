    Calculates the variance of a list of numbers.

    1. Calculate the mean of the list.
    2. Iterate over the list and calculate the squared deviation from the mean for each number.
    3. Sum the squared deviations.
    4. Divide the sum of the squared deviations by the number of numbers in the list.

    Args:
        arr (list): A list of numbers.

    Returns:
        float: The variance of the list.
